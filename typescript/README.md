# 🎭 Playwright TypeScript E2E Tests - Login Page

This project demonstrates end-to-end (E2E) test automation using **Playwright** with **TypeScript**, focused on validating the login page of a web application running at `http://localhost:4200/#/login`.

---

## 🤖 What is Playwright?

Playwright is a framework for automated **end-to-end testing** of web applications.  
It simulates real user actions—like clicking buttons, typing into forms, and navigating pages—across multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

It's a powerful tool to ensure your app works as expected from the user's perspective.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Login validation with multiple scenarios
- Form validation for empty, short, and max-length credentials
- Error handling for server-side failures (mocked)
- Tests written using Playwright’s `@playwright/test` and Page Object Model (POM)
